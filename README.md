# Freakbot

## Background

People in the ATCS 2028 Discord server are known for saying some rather
questionable things. This bot keeps track of who sends the most objectionable
messages using the OpenAI moderation API and a SQLite database. The data is
presented in a leaderboard accessible via slash command.
